# CardView
Copy of CardView to enable custom shadow color

The code is a copy of [CardView][1]. Two attributes are added to `CardView`: `cardShadowStartColor` and `cardShadowEndColor`. 
When specifing these two attributes, alpha results shadow. For example, start color is `#7f00ff00`, and end color is `#0100ff00`.

A simple example is given here. Make a copy to see the effect and make some modifications. Or just copy `cardview` module to project's root directory as
a library.
